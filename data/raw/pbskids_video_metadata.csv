Temple Grandin is an amazing woman who became an accomplished engineer, scientist, biologist and animal behavior specialist. Her achievements are amazing and possible because Temple Grandin is also autistic. This means she sometimes thinks and does things differently because her senses process things a little differently. Also, Temple doesn’t always recognize and respond to people’s feelings in expected ways, but she finds original ways of sharing her ideas and connecting with others. Temple Grandin’s story shows that thinking differently can lead to new and exciting ideas!

Our heroes are sent back in time to meet an amazing racer: Wilma Rudolph. Though, as our trio soon find out, Wilma wasn’t always great at running; in fact, she had to wear a leg brace just to walk until she was nine years old. But, Wilma’s late start didn’t stop her from becoming an Olympic gold medalist! / Xavier, Yadina and Brad spend the morning shoveling snow off the museum steps so people will be able to visit safely, but are aghast to discover there’s no hot chocolate reward for all their hard work! What should they do? There’s only one thing…to the Secret Museum! Our heroes are sent back in time to meet someone who knew about hard work: Jonas Salk. They follow along as Jonas first helps his friends play baseball, then helps millions of kids all around the world by developing a vaccine for polio.  Watching Jonas work hard to accomplish this amazing goal, and expecting nothing in return, helps our trio realize they don’t need a reward for helping people get to the museum safely, because it feels good to help people.

Unfortunately, the Conductor’s father never returned, and is apparently lost. The Conductor decides to take the new Drill Train and tunnel into the future to rescue his missing father! SONG: “THE BRAVEST TROODON” / The Conductor, determined to find his missing father, takes the experimental Drill Train and drills a new Time Tunnel that goes as far into the end of the Mesozoic Era as possible, to drill farther into the future and find his father, Trevor Troodon. Once Dad and Buddy and Tiny get wind of this plan, they come aboard, too. So they all take the Drill Train and drill into the future. They come out in the Ice Age of the Cenozoic Era, where they meet a huge, furry Mastodon named Maurice. Maurice helps them search through the icy wastes until they find a feather-covered Northern Troodon who turns out to indeed be Trevor, the father of Mr. Conductor! A happy reunion for all, and they bring him home to the Age of Dinosaurs.

Years later, he puts his creativity to good use as he invents the game of basketball! Watching James inspires our trio to go home and invent their own game with the equipment they do have; all they need to do is try out different ideas. / Yadina really wants to make friends with a new boy from her class, Ben, by showing him around the museum.  Yadina struggles to make friends with Ben, because he doesn’t want to do things her way – he has his own unique way of experiencing the exhibits.  Unsure how to make friends with Ben now, there’s only one place Yadina can turn…to the Secret Museum! Our heroes are sent back in time to meet another unique person: Temple Grandin. During a playdate with Temple, Yadina is amazed by all of the very different ways Temple approaches activities like kite flying and searching for a missing dog toy.

Elinor, Olive and Ari are happy to welcome new members to The Explorer's Club, but as more and more kids join, a big problem arises: their clubhouse isn't big enough to fit all the new Explorers! When the entire Clubhouse rolls down the hill, Elinor and her friends need to find a solution.

""No Need to Shout""
Elinor loses her voice just before she and her friends are supposed to sing their song for the class. She needs to figure out another way to perform, so she and her friends decide to observe nature outside for some ideas. They notice that all sorts of animals use different ways to communicate by using actions instead of words, like a dog wagging its tail vigorously or a baby crying. This gives Elinor the idea that she can act out the actions of the song during their presentation. The show must go on!

Elinor and her friends are trying to make an awesome couch cushion castle, but they each have their own ideas of how to build it. When they can't seem to share materials, it looks like all hope is lost, until Elinor notices ants walking by her windowsill. Fascinated, the kids follow the ants and notice them co-operating with each other to build the perfect nest. Now they know just what to do.

FR8l_CkKAgc,Elinor Wonders Why FULL EPISODE | The Science of Staying Warm / The Seed of an Idea | PBS KIDS,"""The Science of Staying Warm""
It’s a wintery Saturday morning and Elinor, Olive and Ari are getting ready to go out and play in the snow with other kids, but Olive wonders why she has to wear so many winter clothes. This catches Elinor’s curiosity, so she observes that some kids have thick fur (like her) and others (like Olive) don’t. At the same time, she sees that the kids with thick fur don’t need coats, and the ones without thick fur need thicker coats. They conclude that fur must help animals stay warm. Now that Olive understands, she’s excited to put on her winter stuff and have fun in the snow! 

""The Seed of an Idea""
Elinor becomes fascinated by the Velcro on Ari's new watch and convinces her friends to help her find out how it works. First, they make a list of what Velcro sticks to and what it doesn’t stick to, but they need more observations, so they head out onto the playground. While outside, they observe that Velcro is very similar to a burr seed that is stuck to Ari’s shirt, which is no coincidence at all! That’s when they learn that the invention of Velcro was based off the burr seed. Nature is full of all sorts of inventive ideas!

She’s eager to try the same recipe when she visits her grandma and grandpa, but their backyard is a lot different than Elinor's, because they live in the desert. Elinor learns that different plants grow in different environments as she makes a whole different “Backyard Soup” with her grandparents, where the main ingredient is cactus! 

""Colorful and Tasty""
Elinor and her friends are selling lots of yummy cupcakes, but the problem is no one is buying any. The kids don't understand what's wrong, because everyone loves cupcakes. After observing how flowers attract bees through color and smell, they go back to their bake sale and decorate the table with fantastic colors, and use a fan to spread the aroma of the cupcakes. Before they know it, the place is “buzzing” and they sell every cupcake!

Hmmm, Nature Cat and his gang think Squeeks needs some rest. After all, doesn’t everyone need sleep? Squeeks isn’t so convinced. Are you telling her that horse is sleeping standing up?

VmLVK0DuUks,Xavier Riddle and The Secret Museum FULL EPISODE | I am Mary Shelley / I am Harry Houdini | PBS KIDS,"""I am Mary Shelley""
Xavier and the gang are excited for a Nature Troop campout, where Xavier has volunteered to tell the first campfire story.  There’s just one problem: everyone is expecting a spooky story, but Xavier only knows how to tell silly stories.  What’s he going to do?  He doesn’t want to disappoint everyone.  To the Secret Museum!  Our heroes are sent back in time to meet an expert spooky storyteller: Mary Shelley.  Mary takes our trio on an imaginative playdate where she spins the leaves and wind into a very spooky tale, which Xavier can’t help but turn funny.  Is all hope lost??  Mary helps Xavier see that he can tell a story that’s both spooky AND silly.  The most important thing is to tell stories your own way.

""I am Harry Houdini""
The time has come from Brad to spend his very first night in the museum, and he couldn’t be more excited.  Except, when the lights go out, Brad realizes it’s kind of… gulp… scary there at night.  Too afraid to stay put in his sleeping bag, there’s only one thing left to do… to the Secret Museum!  Our heroes travel back in time to meet someone who knew how to face a scary situation: Harry Houdini.  Harry wants nothing more than to be a brave performer, just like his hero, tightrope walker Fearless Jean.  But, it turns out tightrope walking is scarier than he thought!  Good thing Harry has a trick to help himself, and Brad, make it through to the end: when you’re scared, take a deep breath to calm down and feel better.

Kart Kingdom is based on the system thinking curriculum. Any curriculum and educational resources for Kart Kingdom is developed with the help of our educational advisor, Arizona State University’s Center for Games and Impact.

Kart Kingdom helps players understand systems. A system refers to several different things that work together to create a whole, such as the pipes in the water system. Without the pipes, water cannot travel from the dam to your faucet at home. The idea of systems thinking is for an individual to understand what the system is and how it works.

Play Kart Kingdom at http://to.pbs.org/kidskartkingdom

Kart Kingdom is based on the system thinking curriculum. Any curriculum and educational resources for Kart Kingdom is developed with the help of our educational advisor, Arizona State University’s Center for Games and Impact.

Kart Kingdom helps players understand systems. A system refers to several different things that work together to create a whole, such as the pipes in the water system. Without the pipes, water cannot travel from the dam to your faucet at home. The idea of systems thinking is for an individual to understand what the system is and how it works. To be able to process using systems thinking is a crucial life skill for scientists, engineers, etc.",2015-05-05T14:51:02Z,PT31S,1670257,212,0
